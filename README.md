<h1> Greyscale Pandas & Friends </h1>

<p>
  This whole project is just a way for me to become more produtive. Making certain website greyscale makes them way less interesting to look at, and thus I will waste less time when
  I'm on those websites! The project currently is litteraly just a couple lines of code, and I have to manually input to websites that I don't want to visit, but in the future I hope
  to utilize AI and provide and inital questionaire to classify productive vs unproductivie website. Mayb in the future if you watch an educational youtube video, it won't be 
  greyscale but other content such as Pokeomn(not saying Pokmeon isn't productive) is greyscale. In the future I hope to make log ins, and make this an app.
